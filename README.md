# avadhatra
Our shoe project.
The files uploaded in the repo are only the code written by us (library implementation also included). The imports are at the top of the code in each file. However, the installation of the libraries such as pubspec.yaml file etc. are not shown. The repo also does not include any kind of build files. Only the code written has been submitted for evaluation.
Documentation however, for the files will be updated in the next push.
